# React Ant Design Paginated Table App
Deploye Link (https://main--tushar-zime.netlify.app/).

This is a React application built with Ant Design that retrieves paginated data from a dummy JSON endpoint and populates a table with the fetched data. The application also includes features such as multi-select filtering based on tags and a search input field for filtering posts based on text matches in the body property. The state of pagination, filtering, and search is persisted in the URL to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Features

1. **Data Retrieval**: Fetches paginated data from the dummy JSON endpoint.
2. **Table Population**: Displays fetched data in a paginated table using Ant Design components.
3. **Multi-Select Filter**: Allows users to filter posts based on tags by selecting multiple tags simultaneously.
4. **Search Input Field**: Enables users to filter posts based on text matches in the body property. The table dynamically updates as users type in the search input.
5. **URL Persistence**: Persists the state of pagination, filtering, and search in the URL for a consistent user experience across sessions.
6. **Routing**: Utilizes React Router for navigation within the application.
7. **User Experience**: Designed with a user-friendly interface, clear navigation, and intuitive interactions.
8. **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and devices.
9. **Error Handling**: Implements error handling for scenarios such as failed data retrieval or invalid routes.
